# Professional README Generator

## Description

This is a professional README generator.

To use it, the user would type 'node index.js' into the terminal. They will be presented with a series of questions about their project. The answers they provide will fill in the body of the generated README.

## Tasks

This project was fairly straight forward. The activities in this unit and the mini group project really prepared us well for this homework. I just had to use the same process we had done a number of times up to this point, but make sure to ask for the correct information, and make sure I was generating the correct type of file.

## What I Learned

In doing this project, I became a lot more comfortable installing and using packages in Node. I also learned that I can use node packages and regular JavaScript functions at the same time.
